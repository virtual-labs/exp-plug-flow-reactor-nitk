The following data are obtained in an ideal tubular flow reactor for the gaseous pyrolysis of acetone at 520&deg;C and 1 atm. The reaction is
<center>CH<sub>3</sub>.CO.CH<sub>3</sub> â†’ CH<sub>2</sub>.CO + CH<sub>4</sub></center>

The feed consists of pure acetone, and the reactor is a 3.3 cm i.d. pipe of 80 cm length.
Consider that the reaction mixture obeys ideal gas law and reaction follows second-order
kinetics. Find the reaction velocity constant.
